 * What is Three.js?                              *
 * Three.js is a powerful Javascript Library for  *
 * creating 3D Graphics within the Web Browser.   *
 * Created by Ricardo Cabello aka Mr. Doob using  *
 * WebGL.                                         *

 *                                                *
 * WebGL Stands for Web Graphics Library. WebGL   *
 * is a Javascript API that allows the browser    *
 * to 'Render' 3D Graphics without the use of any *
 * plug-ins. WebGL also allows GPU (Graphics      *
 * Processing Unit) accelerated rendering.        *
 * What does this mean? it is lean, mean and one  *
 * delicious little thing.                        *
 *                                                *
 * Why should we be interested in using Three.js? *
 * In a world where technology continually grows  *
 * and embeds itself in everday life, In a world  *
 * where users are constantly seeking immersive   *
 * experiences, the onus is on us as Devs to turn *
 * dreams in to reality. I am of the opinion that *
 * the biggest illusion we've ever been fed is    *
 * that code is black and white. Code is every    *
 * single color you could ever fathom.            *
